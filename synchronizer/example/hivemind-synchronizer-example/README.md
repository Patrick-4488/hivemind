# Hivemind synchronizer example

The Hivemind synchronizer example contains a basic application that provides a example of how to implementation Hivemind synchronization in an application.

## Setting up a development environment

The application requires Java 11 or later and will support any new Java releases as soon as possible after release.
Build the Hivemind artifact before building the example project, so that it is available in your local repository. This is required since Hivemind is not yet in the central repository.
